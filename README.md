# Bible
Repo tracking the genealogy, history, and timeline of the Bible with initial notes in obsidian md and then transformed to Bible webpage and app that's connected to portfolio site. This repo will also have examples and follow the book "Messiah" by Jerry D. Thomas as well.

Get [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view the correct notes and formatting of markdown files. (md still available to view and read through repo but harder to read with no fanciness)
