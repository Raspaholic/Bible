## The Account of Creation (Genesis 1: 1-31)

### Day 1
>In the beginning, God created the heavens [^1] and earth[^2]; earth being formless and empty, darkness covered the deep waters. The Spirit of God hovering over the surface of the waters.
>God said, 

>[!quote] "Let there be light," 

>and there was light. God saw the light was good. He then separated the light from darkness. God called the light "day"[^3] and the darkness[^4] "night". Evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.

### Day 3
>God said, "Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear." God called the dry ground "land"[^6] and the waters "seas".[^7] God saw it was good. God said, "Let the land sprout with vegetation--every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” The land produced vegetation--all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees wit seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind.[^8] God saw that it was good, evening passed and morning came marking the third day.

God made two great lights--the larger one to govern the day[^9], and the smaller one to govern the night[^10]. He also made the stars.[^11] God set these lights in the sky to light the earth, to govern the day and night, to separate the light from darkness. God saw that it was good, evening passed and morning came marking the fourth day.

God created great sea creatures[^12] and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water,[^13] and every sort of bird--each producing offspring of the same kind.[^14] God saw that it was good.

God made all sorts of wild animals,[^17] livestock,[^15] and small animals,[^16] each able to produce offspring of the same kind. God saw it was good. God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground." God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them, male and female.[^18] 
>	God blessed them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground." God said, "Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food. And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has life."

### Day 7

## The Man and Woman in Eden (Genesis 2: 4-25)

>[!note]- When the Lord God made the earth and heavens, 
>neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the Lord God had not yet sent rain to water the earth, there were no people to cultivate the soil. Instead, springs came up from the ground and watered all the land. 

### Adam
>Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils, and the man became a living person.[^20]

[^20]: Man of dust (Adam)

### The Garden of Eden
>Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east,[^21] and there he placed the man he had made. The Lord God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground--trees that were beautiful and that produced delicious fruit. In the middle of the garden he placed the tree of life[^22] and the tree of the knowledge of good[^23] and evil. A river flowed from the land of Eden, watering the garden then dividing into four branches. First branch: Pishon, flowed around the entire land of Havilah. Second branch: Gihon, flowed around the entire land of Cush. Third branch: Tigris, flowed east of the land of Asshur. Fourth branch: Euphrates. God placed the man in Eden to tend and watch over it. God warned him, "You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden--except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die."

[^21]: The Garden of Eden
[^22]: Tree of life
[^23]: Tree of the knowledge of good and evil

### Eve
>Then the Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him." So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one. He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds, all wild animals. Still there was no helper just right for him.[^24]
>So the Lord God caused the man into a deep sleep. While the man slept, the Lord God took out one of the man's ribs and closed up the opening. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib, and he brought her to the man.[^25]
>"At last!" the man exclaimed.
>"This one is bone from my bone, and flesh from my flesh! She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken from 'man.'"[^26]
>This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one. Now the man and his wife were both naked, but felt no shame.[^27]

[^24]: Adam names all the animals
[^25]: Eve is made from one of Adam's ribs
[^26]: Difference between man and woman
[^27]: Adam and Eve naked without shame

## The Man and Woman Sin (Genesis 3: 1-19)
>The serpent was the shrewest of all the wild animals the Lord God had made. One day the man asked the woman, "Did God really say you must'nt eat the fruit from the trees in the garden?" "Of course we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden," she replied. "It's only the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that we're not allowed to eat. God said, 'You mustn't eat it or even touch it; if you do, you will die." 
>The serpent replied, "You won't die! God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil."
>Eve was convinced. She saw the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, she wanted the wisdom it would give her. She took some of the fruit and ate it. She gave some to her husband, who was with her and he ate it too.[^28] That moment their eyes were opened, the suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. The sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.[^29] 
>When the cool evening breezes were blowing, both heard the Lord God walking about the garden. They hid from Him among the trees. God called to the man, "Where are you?"
>He replied, "I heard you walking in the garden, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked."
>"Who told you that you were naked?" the Lord God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"
>The man replied, "It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit, and I ate it."
>The Lord God asked the woman, "What have you done?"
>"The serpent deceived me," she replied. "That's why I ate it."
>The Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all animals, domestic and wild. You will crawl on your belly, groveling in the dust as long as you live. I will cause hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel."
>He said to the woman, "I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy, and in pain you will give birth. You will desire to control your husband, but he will rule over you."
>He said to the man, "Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat, the ground is cursed because of you. All your life you will struggle to scratch a living thing from it. It will grow thorns and thistles for you, though you will eat of its grains. By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat until you return to the ground from which you were made. For you were made from dust, and to dust you will return."

## Paradise Lost: God's Judgment (Genesis 3: 20-24)
>Then the man--Adam--named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all who live. God made clothing from animal skins for Adam and his wife. God said, "Look, the human beings have become like us, knowing both good and evil. What if they reach out, take fruit from the tree of life, and eat if? Then they will live forever! Then they will live forever!" God banished them from Eden, and sent Adam out to cultivate the ground from which he had been made. After sending out Adam, God stationed mighty cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden. He placed a flaming sword that flashed back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
